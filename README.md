# Get File From Onedrive And Upload To GCP Via Python

Hi, I gonna show how do I access and get file from OneDrive via Python. In detail of access and list files from OneDrive, you can see more detail in 
https://github.com/pranabdas/Access-OneDrive-via-Microsoft-Graph-Python from pranapdas. 
I apply and add datetime conditions about created datetime and last modified date and file condition for getting specific files. 
After got all files, I gonna load those files to the bucket in GCP. 

# Get Access Token From POSTMAN 
In this project, I used POSTMAN. You choose Authorization field and select OAuth 2.0 than you fill about details of App Register from Azure and click 'Get New Access Token'.
